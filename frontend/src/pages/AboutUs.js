                We're dedicated to solving one of the most challenging aspects of college life: 
                planning your academic path. Our platform empowers UCI students to make informed decisions about 
                their course selections, ensuring they meet graduation requirements while balancing personal 
                interests and career goals.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div className="story-content">
            <p>
              Zotgraduator was born from a side project created by Jasper, who developed a course plan 
              optimizer that uses algorithmic techniques to build optimal academic schedules. By scraping yearly 
              course offerings and analyzing prerequisites, the tool creates personalized 4-year plans that 
              minimize conflicts and maximize efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was further developed through UCI's Internet Applications Engineering course 
              (IN4MATX 124), where we expanded the concept into a full-fledged web application. The course 
              covered essential web technologies such as HTTP, REST, Remote Procedure Calls, Web Services, 
              data representations, content distribution networks, and identity management.
            </p>
            <p>
              As students ourselves, we understand the frustrations of course planning and have experienced 
              firsthand how challenging it can be to balance requirements, preferences, and availability. 
              Zotgraduator is our solution to this universal student problem, designed by students, for students.
